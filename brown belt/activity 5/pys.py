Should this one be a pys?

If so, we can ask the students to create a game which has a rectangle that moves around using the mouse then have it
change color once it hits a specific place on the screen.

It could have a second part as well where the student takes this same idea and instead has to use the arrow keys.

Something we may want to consider is whether the student should be given some of the code as starting code and left
with blanks that they need to complete themselves.
